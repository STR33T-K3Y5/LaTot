# TODO: Backstage.com Style Hero Section Implementation

## Analysis Summary

### Current State:
- **Home.jsx**: Already has hero section with word-swap-container structure
- **index.css**: Only has `.body { margin-top: 100px; }`
- **Goal**: Replicate Backstage.com hiring hero with animated word swapping

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Update Home.jsx Hero Section ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Modify the animated word span to include all words for animation
- [x] Add proper class names for styling
- [x] Keep existing structure but enhance for CSS animation

### Step 2: Add CSS to index.css ✅ COMPLETED
- [x] Hero section container styling (dark crimson background)
- [x] Typography styles (matching Backstage fonts)
- [x] Word swap animation keyframes
- [x] Button styling (gold #c59740, white text, rounded corners)
- [x] Responsive design for mobile

### Animation Details:
- Words to cycle: Opportunity, Purpose, Growth, Impact, Innovation, Possibility
- Animation: Smooth fade/slide transition
- Loop: Infinite
- Text color: #c59740 for animated span

### Styling Requirements:
- Background: Dark grey crimson (moody, similar to Backstage)
- Typography: Modern sans-serif (matching Backstage)
- Button: Gold background #c59740, white text, rounded border
- All text white except animated word (gold)

## Files to Modify:

## Deliverable:
Hero section with animated word swapping like Backstage.com hiring page
