# Carousel Animation Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Files to Modify:
1. `src/pages/Home.jsx` - React component logic
2. `src/index.css` - CSS animations and transitions

### Current Implementation:
- Carousel shows 3 items: prev (peek), current (center), next (peek)
- Uses basic CSS transitions on transform properties
- Has direction state but not used for animation
- Transitions are abrupt, not smooth sliding

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: React Component Updates (Home.jsx)

#### 1.1 Add Animation State Management
```jsx
// Current states:
- [x] Test carousel navigation on mobile
- [x] Verify no style leakage to other sections
- [x] Check accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)

## Additional Enhancements Implemented
- [x] Smooth fade-in animations for #hero-section (staggered)
- [x] Moving gradient animation on "YOUR WORLD" text
- [x] Professional serif fonts (Reckless-Bold, Libre-Baskerville)
- [x] Enhanced carousel item transitions (cubic-bezier easing)
- [x] Accessible arrow buttons with focus states
- [x] Touch-friendly swipe gestures on mobile
