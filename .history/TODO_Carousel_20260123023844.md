# Carousel Animation Implementation Plan

## Current State Analysis

### Files to Modify:
1. `src/pages/Home.jsx` - React component logic
2. `src/index.css` - CSS animations and transitions

### Current Implementation:
- Carousel shows 3 items: prev (peek), current (center), next (peek)
- Uses basic CSS transitions on transform properties
- Has direction state but not used for animation
- Transitions are abrupt, not smooth sliding
- [x] Implement carousel container with overflow
- [x] Add peek effect for side items (blur, opacity, scale)
- [x] Style navigation arrows
- [x] Add typography for about-header, about-subheader, about-description
- [x] Implement gradient text for "YOUR WORLD" with moving animation
- [x] Add responsive breakpoints (mobile: 780×440, desktop: 1440×880)
- [x] Add smooth transition animations

## Phase 3: Testing & Verification
- [x] Test carousel navigation on desktop
- [x] Test carousel navigation on mobile
- [x] Verify no style leakage to other sections
- [x] Check accessibility (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)

## Additional Enhancements Implemented
- [x] Smooth fade-in animations for #hero-section (staggered)
- [x] Moving gradient animation on "YOUR WORLD" text
- [x] Professional serif fonts (Reckless-Bold, Libre-Baskerville)
- [x] Enhanced carousel item transitions (cubic-bezier easing)
- [x] Accessible arrow buttons with focus states
- [x] Touch-friendly swipe gestures on mobile
