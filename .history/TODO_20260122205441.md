# TODO: Backstage.com Style Hero Section Implementation

## Analysis Summary

### Current State:
- **Home.jsx**: Already has hero section with word-swap-container structure
- **index.css**: Only has `.body { margin-top: 100px; }`
- **Goal**: Replicate Backstage.com hiring hero with animated word swapping

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Update Home.jsx Hero Section
- [ ] Modify the animated word span to include all words for animation
- [ ] Add proper class names for styling
